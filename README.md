Hi, my name is Diego and i'm 20 years old, i'm currently studying Software Engineering in Universidad Autónoma de Occidente Campus Culiacán.
I like to learn in udemy courses and my goal is to get a job as a Developer. I just finished a python course in udemy, now i'm watching a javascript course,
after i finish the javascript course, I will take a MySQL that I got recently.

 I'll be posting some projects. Thanks for Reading.
